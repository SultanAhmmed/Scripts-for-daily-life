2. **Extract** it anywhere on your PC.
3. **Make sure Python 3 is installed** on your system.

## 🚀 Launch the Server

- Just **OPEN the folder**.
- open terminal in that location.
- **Remmber to RUN with sudo** 
```
chmod +x Server_runner.sh
sudo ./Server_runner.sh
```
- Just **RUN** those command and 
- Sit back, relax, maybe grab a cup of coffee ☕ — the script will take care of everything!
- It will **automatically install all required dependencies**.

## 🌐 Start Your Project

- When prompted, **enter the path to your project folder** (where your `index.html` file is located).
- Press `Enter`, and... **Boom!** 🎉  
  Your live server will start with the default browser automatically with a beautiful banner.
